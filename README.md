# Buncher Machine Panel Block Diagram
Buncher Machine Panel Block Diagram (Internship Project)

---

## ðŸ”Ž Overview
During my internship at Cable Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., I was assigned my first technical project: create a complete **power distribution block diagram** for a redesigning buncher machine panel board.  

I didnâ€™t have specialized electrical CAD software at the time, so I used **AutoCAD** to manually draw every block and connection for over **30 components**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- Manual creation of all blocks and connections in AutoCAD
- **Traced each component path carefully and assembled the diagram component by component** during troubleshooting to ensure accuracy
- Update the diagram for changes during troubleshooting and system updates
