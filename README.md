# Buncher-Machine-Panel-Block-Diagram
Buncher Machine Panel Block Diagram (Internship Project)

## Overview
During my internship at Cable Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., I was assigned my first technical project: create a complete **power distribution block diagram** for a redesigning buncher machine panel board.  

I didnâ€™t have specialized electrical CAD software at the time, so I used **AutoCAD** to manually draw every block and connection for over **30 components**.

## Project Highlights
- Manual creation of all blocks and connections in AutoCAD
- **Traced each component path carefully** to ensure the diagram matched the real system
- Update the diagram for changes during troubleshooting and system updates

## Lessons Learned
- Importance of detailed tracing and accuracy in electrical diagrams
- Flexibility to update designs in response to real-world changes
- Hands-on experience with AutoCAD for complex electrical layouts
