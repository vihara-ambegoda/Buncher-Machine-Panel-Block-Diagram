# Buncher-Machine-Panel-Block-Diagram
Buncher Machine Panel Block Diagram (Internship Project)

## Overview
During my internship at Map of Cable Solutions (Pvt) Ltd., I was assigned my first technical project: redesign a machine panel board and create a complete **power distribution block diagram**.  

I didnâ€™t have specialized electrical CAD software at the time, so I used **AutoCAD** to manually draw every block and connection for over **30 components**.

## Project Highlights
- Manual creation of all blocks and connections in AutoCAD
- Adapted diagram for changes during troubleshooting and system updates
- Learned real-world problem-solving and electrical design workflow
